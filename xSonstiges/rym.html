<div style="padding:50px;">error: Your IP address has been banned
  from this site.  This could happen for a number of reasons:
<br /><br />
1) You requested a very large number of pages in a very short time, causing problems
for our server (this can happen if you hit 'refresh' over and over).  In this case, just
wait a few minutes and you will be unbanned.
<br /><br />

2) You could have been banned by mistake; sometimes our banning policies
are too strict and some IP addresses are banned by accident (this is the
most likely case).
<br /><br />

3) You (or someone with the same IP address as you) might be using a
program to download pages from this site automatically.  This is forbidden
by our terms of service.
<br /><br />

4) Someone with your IP address may have violated another section of our
terms of service (for example, behaving disrespectfully toward other
   members of the site)
<br /><br />

If you think that the ban was a mistake (or have no idea why you are
banned), email custservice <SF> (at) <SS>rateyourmusic.com and ask that your IP
(141.45.206.179) be unbanned from this site.   Don't forget to tell us the IP address.
<br /><br />
If you are actually using a program to download pages and would like to
know how to do so in the future without being banned, please email me at
the address above and explain what it is that you're trying to do.
<br /><br />
Thanks,
<br /><br />
